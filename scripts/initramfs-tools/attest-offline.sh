# OFFLINE ATTESTATION SCRIPT
# ===========================
# Attempts to unseal the rootfs using a hardware-bound key derived from the
# SEV-SNP chip (VCEK) mixed with the launch measurement.  On first boot or
# after chip migration, falls back to online attestation to obtain the VMK,
# then enrolls the derived key into LUKS slot 1 for all subsequent boots.
#
# LUKS slot layout:
#   Slot 0 - sealed VMK (unlocked via online attestation, snpguard service)
#   Slot 1 - hardware-bound derived key (unlocked offline, no network needed)
#
# The derived key is unique to the combination of this physical AMD chip
# (identified by the VCEK), the launch measurement (firmware + kernel +
# initrd digest), the image ID registered with the attestation server, and
# the guest launch policy.  It cannot be reproduced on a different chip, with
# a different image, or under a different launch policy.
#
# Fields mixed into the derived key and why each one matters:
#   --mix-measurement   Launch digest covering OVMF + kernel + initrd +
#                       cmdline.  Implicitly covers id_key_digest and
#                       author_key_digest because the signed ID block that
#                       produces those digests commits to the measurement.
#                       The server matches attestation records by all three.
#   --mix-image-id      UUID identifying the registered image.  The server
#                       explicitly filters attestation records by image_id
#                       (report.image_id); without this flag a derived key
#                       computed from a different registration would still
#                       match the measurement but not the server record.
#   --mix-policy        Guest launch policy bitmask (controls hypervisor
#                       capabilities: debug mode, live migration, SMT, etc.).
#                       Mixing the policy ensures that launching the image
#                       under a different policy (e.g. with debug mode
#                       enabled) invalidates the offline key and forces
#                       re-enrollment via online attestation.
#   --vmpl 0            Explicitly derive the key at VMPL 0, matching the
#                       server requirement (reports from VMPL > 0 are
#                       rejected).  The default is already 0, but stating
#                       it explicitly documents the intent.
#
# Network is required exactly once:
#   - On the very first boot (slot 1 not yet enrolled).
#   - After chip migration (VCEK changes -> derived key differs -> slot 1 must
#     be re-enrolled).  Once re-enrolled on the new chip, subsequent boots
#     proceed offline again.
