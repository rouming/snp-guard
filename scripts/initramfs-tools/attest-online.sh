# ONLINE ATTESTATION SCRIPT
# ==========================
# Unseals the rootfs VMK by performing a full remote attestation handshake
# with the SnpGuard server on every boot.  Network access is required for
# every boot when using this script.
#
# LUKS slot layout:
#   Slot 0 - sealed VMK (unlocked via online attestation, snpguard service)
#
# Boot flow:
#   1. Configure networking (udevadm settle + DHCP + /32 routing workaround).
#   2. Resolve the root block device from the kernel command line.
#   3. Perform remote attestation: the snpguard-client generates an AMD
#      SEV-SNP attestation report, sends it to the server together with the
#      sealed VMK blob, and receives the VMK decrypted and re-encrypted
#      under an ephemeral session key.
#   4. Unlock the root filesystem by passing the VMK to cryptsetup.
#
# For a variant that avoids network on every boot see attest-offline.sh.

# Cloud providers that assign a /32 address (single-host subnet) require an
# explicit on-link route to the gateway because the kernel would otherwise
# refuse to add a default route (the gateway appears off-subnet).  This
# workaround reads the variables written by ipconfig into /run/net-$DEVICE.conf
# and injects the missing routes when the condition is detected.
