# SnpGuard - SEV-SNP Attestation Service

**Attestation service and key broker for AMD SEV-SNP Confidential VMs.**

SnpGuard is a transparent, user-controlled attestation and key broker
for VM-level confidential computing, covering the full lifecycle from
image conversion through measurement, key release, and artifact
updates. Hyperscalers either abstract this process away or leave it to
the user; SnpGuard makes every step explicit and auditable.

## Motivation

While libraries for SNP exist (thanks to
[VirTEE](https://virtee.io/)), the ecosystem lacks an end-to-end
toolchain for bootstrapping and attesting confidential VMs. Currently,
operators must stitch together image builders, measurement
calculators, and key brokers manually. `snp-guard` unifies this into a
binding workflow: `convert` -> `register` -> `boot` (with optional
`embed` step). It is designed specifically for the VM image lifecycle,
complementing container-focused solutions such as Confidential
Containers that operate at a different abstraction level.

## The Problem

Deploying AMD SEV-SNP VMs requires solving three technical challenges:

1. **The Measurement Problem:** To verify a CVM, you must calculate
   the precise launch digest of its firmware, kernel, initrd, and
   kernel command line. Any update to these artifacts changes the
   measurement, breaking trust. Calculating this manually is
   error-prone and brittle.

2. **The Secret Delivery Problem:** The VM needs its volume master
   key (VMK) before it can mount the root filesystem. However, you cannot
   bake the key into the image (it would be visible in the host
   storage) or send it over the network without verifying the receiver
   first.

3. **The Bootstrapping Problem:** You need a trusted agent inside the
   guest's early boot environment (initrd) to perform the
   cryptographic handshake with the attestation server before the OS
   creates users or networking configurations.

## The Solution

SnpGuard solves these problems by injecting a lightweight Rust-based
agent into the VM's initrd and providing a centralized server to
manage measurements.

* **Image Conversion:** The `snpguard-image` tool takes a stock
  QCOW2 (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu), encrypts the root partition (LUKS),
  injects the `snpguard-client` and a dedicated hook into the initrd
  and extracts the exact kernel/initrd/cmdline that will be used for
  booting.

* **Registration & Measurement:** The extracted artifacts are
  registered with the SnpGuard Server. The server records the
  measurements and returns a `launch-artifacts.tar.gz` bundle
  containing the kernel, initrd, launch configuration (vCPU count,
  vCPU model, and guest policy), and the cryptographic ID Block and
  Authentication Block required to launch the VM.  The SnpGuard Server
  leverages launch artifacts measurement to the [`sev` Rust
  library](https://github.com/virtee/sev) and [`snpguest`
  tool](https://github.com/virtee/snpguest) from the VirTEE community.

* **Visual Management (Web UI):** A built-in dashboard allows
  administrators to view and register images, launch artifacts, and
  manage API tokens.

* **Online Attestation:** On boot, the client (running in the initrd)
  generates an AMD SEV-SNP attestation report. The SnpGuard Server
  verifies this report against the registered measurements and
  securely releases the volume master key (VMK) by encrypting it with
  a user's ephemeral session key. Network access is required on every
  boot.

* **Offline Attestation:** An optional mode where a hardware-bound key
  derived from the AMD chip and the launch measurement is enrolled into
  a second LUKS slot after the first successful online attestation.
  Subsequent boots unlock the disk without any network access. Online
  attestation is used automatically as a fallback on first boot, after
  chip migration, or after an artifact renewal.

* **Attestation Renewal:** Kernel, initrd, or firmware updates produce
  a new measurement, which would normally require re-encrypting the
  disk from scratch. Instead, `snpguard-client attest renew` (run from
  inside the live VM) uploads the new artifacts to a pending record on
  the server and writes them to the inactive A/B slot on the
  `LAUNCH_ARTIFACTS` partition. On the next boot the new measurement is
  attested and the pending record is promoted, making the update fully
  atomic and verifiable.

## Quick Start

If you're cloning the repository for the first time, initialize the
git submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This is required because `snpguest` is included as a git submodule.

### 1. Attestation Server & Web Dashboard

Generate TLS certificates:

```bash
./scripts/generate-tls-certs.sh --output data/tls --ip ${IP}
```

If a hostname should be used instead of `${IP}`, please provide the
`--dns <HOSTNAME>` option instead of the `--ip` option. Multiple `--ip
<IP>` or `--dns <HOSTNAME>` entries can be provided one after another.

Start the server. The server provides both the Attestation API and the
Management Web UI.

```bash
make run-server
```

On first start, the server generates a master password, an HPKE
ingestion keypair, and an Ed25519 identity keypair, printing the
master password to stdout. Copy it, then:

* Navigate to the Web Dashboard at https://${HOSTNAME_OR_IP}:3000
* Log in with the master password
* Go to `Tokens` to create an API token for your CLI client

### 2. Attestation Client

Configure the client to connect to the attestation server:

```bash
cargo run --bin snpguard-client config login \
  --url https://${HOSTNAME_OR_IP}:3000 \
  --token ${TOKEN}
```

### 3. Image Conversion

Download a standard cloud image and convert it to a confidential-ready
image. This process uses **qemu-img** and **libguestfs** to perform offline
manipulation of the QCOW2 image: root filesystem encryption (LUKS),
partition management, and injecting the attestation agent into the
initrd.

```bash
# Download latest Debian trixie
wget https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/trixie/latest/debian-13-genericcloud-amd64.qcow2

# Convert standard Debian to a confidential-ready Debian
cargo run --bin snpguard-image convert \
  --in-image ./debian-13-genericcloud-amd64.qcow2 \
  --out-image confidential.qcow2 \
  --out-staging ./staging \
  --firmware ./OVMF.AMDSEV.fd
```

**Note 1**: To use AMD SEV-SNP technology, SEV-SNP must be enabled in
guest kernels, which is verified by the image tool. For example,
default Debian cloud images support SEV-SNP starting from the Trixie
distribution (Debian 13). Ubuntu introduced SEV-SNP support starting
from Ubuntu Noble (Ubuntu 24.04).

**Note 2**: The image tool requires `qemu-img` and `libguestfs` to be
installed on the system for the `convert` subcommand to inspect and
modify the QCOW2 image.

**Note 3 (offline attestation):** By default the VM contacts the
attestation server on every boot. Pass `--offline-attestation` to
`snpguard-image convert` to inject the offline attestation hook
instead. After the first successful online boot a hardware-bound key
derived from the AMD SEV-SNP chip and the launch measurement is
enrolled into a second LUKS slot. Subsequent boots unlock the disk
without any network access, falling back to online attestation only
when the chip changes (e.g. after VM migration) or after a kernel or
initrd update is enrolled via `attest renew`.

**Note 4:** The image tool lists the available kernels and initrd
images with their kernel parameters. By default, the GRUB default
kernel is selected automatically; if no default is set in the GRUB
configuration, the first SEV-SNP supported entry is used. Pass
`--interactive` to be prompted to choose interactively instead.

**Note 5:** The OVMF firmware binary must include `SNP_KERNEL_HASHES`,
which is achieved by the special AmdSevX64 build. Refer to [this
guide](https://rouming.github.io/2025/04/01/coco-with-amd-sev.html#guest-ovmf-firmware)
to build OVMF with `SNP_KERNEL_HASHES` enabled.

### 4. Register Attestation Record

Register the new image with the server. This uploads the measurements
and the encrypted key, and returns the signed launch artifacts.

```bash
cargo run --bin snpguard-client manage register \
  --os-name Debian13-CVM \
  --vcpus 4 --vcpu-type EPYC-Turin \
  --allowed-smt \
  --min-tcb-bootloader 0 --min-tcb-tee 0 --min-tcb-snp 0 --min-tcb-microcode 0 \
  --staging-dir ./staging \
  --out-bundle ./launch-artifacts.tar.gz
```

You can now view this registered image and its measurements in the Web
Dashboard.

### 5. (Optional) Embed Launch Artifacts

Optionally, you can embed the launch artifacts bundle into the
confidential image. This creates a dedicated partition with the label
`LAUNCH_ARTIFACTS` containing the boot artifacts (kernel, initrd,
ID-Block, Auth-Block) in an A/B directory structure.

```bash
cargo run --bin snpguard-image embed \
  --image ./confidential.qcow2 \
  --in-bundle ./launch-artifacts.tar.gz
```

**What the embed command does:**

1. Checks for an existing partition with the `LAUNCH_ARTIFACTS` filesystem label
2. If missing, creates a new 512MB partition, formats it as ext4, and sets the label
3. Wipes the partition content (idempotent operation)
4. Extracts the bundle contents into `/A` directory
5. Creates `/B` directory for future updates
6. Creates symlink `/artifacts -> A` pointing to the active artifacts

The A/B structure enables atomic artifact updates: new attested
artifacts are written to the inactive directory (e.g., `/B`), then the
symlink is atomically switched to point to the new directory. On the
next VM poweroff/poweron cycle, the new artifacts will be used.

**Note 1**: The embed command requires `qemu-img` and `libguestfs` to be installed,
same as the `convert` subcommand.

**Note 2**: This step is optional if you supply artifacts externally
when launching the VM. However, the `LAUNCH_ARTIFACTS` partition is
required if you want to use `snpguard-client attest renew` from inside
the running VM: that command writes updated kernel and initrd into the
inactive slot and flips the active symlink, so the next boot picks up
the new artifacts. Without this partition, artifact renewal is not
possible.

### 6. Run CVM

Launch the confidential VM on the platform using the secured disk and
the signed artifacts:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/launch-qemu-snp.sh \
  --hda confidential.qcow2 \
  --artifacts launch-artifacts.tar.gz
```

**Prerequisites:** The launch script requires `jq` to be installed for
parsing the launch configuration from the launch artifacts bundle.

Upon boot, the VM will verify itself against the server, receive the
key, unlock the disk, and boot the OS.

## Architecture Components

* **snpguard-server:** The core service provides a REST API and a web
  UI for management, validates hardware reports against AMD's
  certificate chain, and securely releases the volume master key.

* **snpguard-image:** CLI tool that leverages **libguestfs** for
  offline image manipulation. It automates the encryption of the
  rootfs, the injection of the attestation agent into the initrd, and
  embedding launch artifacts into dedicated partitions.

* **snpguard-client:** A dual-purpose Rust binary:
  * **Host**: Used by developers to register images and download
    launch bundles (`manage` subcommand).
  * **Guest**: A lightweight, static binary (built against the `musl`
    C standard library for a smaller footprint, and built as static to
    avoid any external dependencies) embedded in the VM's initrd.
    Provides two attestation subcommands: `attest report` (VMK release
    for LUKS unlock during boot) and `attest renew` (artifact renewal
    from inside the running VM, producing a pending record on the
    server).

## Tools

A pre-built Docker image with `snpguard-image` and `snpguard-client` is available
without building Rust locally:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/<owner>/snpguard-tools:latest
```

See the [User Guide](docs/user_guide.md#getting-the-tools) for full details,
including how to build from source.

## Server Docker

Build and run the attestation server container:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t snp-guard .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name snp-guard \
